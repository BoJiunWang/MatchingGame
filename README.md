Practice for Cocos2d-x

Based on Cocos2d-x 3.17.1.

MyGame folder's code is the first prototype, MyGame_final's code has been redesigned but maybe not Good yet, cause this is just my practice for Cocos2d-x. Maybe I will rewrite ALL code after I get more experience on my job.

In MyGame_final folder is using some class under Toolbox library, which cannot be open-source but it almost inheritance form Cocos2d-x, you can try to replace it with Cocos2d-x class by yourself.

If you have any suggestion, just contact me :)
